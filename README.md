# Movie List Starter Repo
This repo will provide a starting point for building Movie List, an educational prompt to practice building full-stack React Applications. The starter repo comes with full webpack setup, with the exception of a single transpilation error, embedded to allow students to practice.

## Setup
- Clone the repo to your desired directory
- Setup desired NPM scripts (i.e., what should the package.json file look like in the "scripts" section, how do we want to start our application?)
- Run webpack and review the transpiled output--does the React code look as you expect?
- Debug your transpilation!
- If you are stuck, check out the solution branch (after thinking through the debugging process and discussing with a peer).

What is Movie List? 

Movie List is a prompt for a front-end app. The purpose is to give you an additional exercise in working with React so that you may:

Better understand your current comprehension level with React
Determine what areas you need additional training / learning with React concepts and functionality
Increase your comfort level with the front-end portion of a Full Stack Application
Movie List is not a test and not an assessment. It will not be reviewed by the staff to assess your performance (unless you book an office hour or we reach out to you!) and is solely intended for you to get more practice and identify areas of improvement for yourself.

How should I approach completing this repo?

1. Set up your dev environment first. You have a few options for this:
  a. Hard Mode: Learn webpack (hint: checkout the webpack docs and babel loader docs)
  b. Medium Mode: Set up files similarly to the recast.ly sprint (with a src and compiled folder), using babel to transpile. This mode is the *default suggestion*.
  c. Easy Mode: Use JS Fiddle or similar
Note: do not use generators like create-react-app or react-boilerplate, as you will not be able to use those throughout the program
2. Once you've set up your dev environment, work through each level to MVP (minimum viable product) before moving to the next level.

3. While you're working through each level, try to only use official documentation. Try to not use Stack Overflow, your own notes, past sprint code, or any other external resources. This will help you develop familiarity with the docs as well as get you acclimated to a real test-like environment!
    a. See below for a list of suggested resources!
4. If you do need to reference past code/Stack Overflow, write down what topics you needed extra help on. Then, go find these topics in the official documentation.
